### README File For Hop NAM Mapping Project ###
## Author: Patrick Woods ##

The code contained in this repo are those used to process and analyze all data generated generated for the Hop NAM experiment conducted by the USDA - ARS. 

Two script files are present, one written in R (version 4.2.0) and the other written in Python (version 3.11.3).

Both scripts achieve the same results by estimating broad sense heritability, calculating estimated marginal means and converting these means to binary (0, 1 format).

Currently only the R script possesses the code for quantile normalization of susceptibility phenotypes. This functionality will be available in the python script in the next releases.
